Fast-paced 3D racing game on a cube with gameplay similar to Snake / Tron (1982): control a car on a cube faces, avoid opponent and survive the longest.

There is a single player mode and a two players online mode with geo-localized matchmaking. The game was made for two players, the single player AI is crude.

My interest was mostly technical: a cross platform game on a cube with glow aesthetic.

It use Three.js and was ported to Android with Cordova, all ads are removed on this version.

The main inspiration was an [Evaldraw](http://advsys.net/ken/download.htm#evaldraw) example game made by Ken Silverman which was a snake on a cube.

Always wanted to turn it into a single player snake game but got bored. :) (wouldn't be hard: adding some bonus / score / goal and removing trail fade would be the main thing missing)

It use my build system [pyNut](https://github.com/grz0zrg/pynut).
